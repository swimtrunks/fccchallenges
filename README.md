# These Challenges...
I have been working through the freeCodeCamp challenges for front end development and I wanted to:
<br>
one. I want to commit to utilizing my github account as much as possible by building and submitting code everyday or so.<br>
two. Note all the challenges that gave me a huge problem. (mostly javascript at this point)

I hope to come back to these challenges to be able to find alternate solutions and to also have a more solid understanding of the concepts covered in them.
